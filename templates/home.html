        Nutrition is the process of utilising food for growth, metabolism and repair of tissues. The relationship between diet and nutrition and health is 2-way; health status can be affected by nutrient deficiency and vice versa.
        The definition of what constitutes a healthy diet continually shifts to reflect the evolving understanding of the roles that different foods, essential nutrients, and other food components play in health and disease. 
        A large and growing body of evidence supports that intake of certain types of nutrients, specific food groups, or overarching dietary patterns positively influences health and promotes the prevention of common non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 
        Greater consumption of health-promoting foods and limited intake of unhealthier options are intrinsic to the eating habits of certain regional diets such as the Mediterranean diet or have been constructed as part of dietary patterns designed to reduce disease risk, 
        such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets. In comparison with a more traditional Western diet, these healthier alternatives are higher in plant-based foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts and lower in animal-based foods, particularly fatty and processed meats.
        Edi-Xpert will help track the current status of Health and to better plan the user's Diet to make better food choices for a better and healthier lifestyle. This system takes into account various factors and supporting clinical and epidemiologic data for Diet Recommendations that have been proven to prevent disease and/or positively influenceÂ health.
