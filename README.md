<h1> Edi-Xpert-A-Diet-Expert-System </h1>
<p>
  The proposed system is divided into three modules: Input, Operational, and output. 
The input module consists of all the inputs such as the user’s login information,
user’s Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Body-fat percentage information, Daily Activity, their Diet
Goals (Weight Gain, Weight Loss, etc.) The operational module consists of the algorithm and
code to work on the database and recommends the diet to the user according to their Body fat
percentage, BMI, and Goal. It also consists of a way to record their daily status of calorie intake
and keep a check on their diet. Finally, the output module displays the record on the Dashboard
and gives a graphical representation of the Calorie intake by the user and how far the user is from
reaching his or her goal.
